=================

This mobile application came out of a need to place a particular Android device in a specific jurisdiction.  
However, it has to be able to do that without a connection to the Internet.  
So, instead of being able to use a tool like the Google Maps API, the system has to have a local database of GPS coordinates to define where the current GPS position (taken from the device) is within that database.  
The UI is incredibly simple as this was written to be included as a part of a larger overall application.
